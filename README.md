# Mortgage Calculator

This is a simple Python script to calculate the monthly mortgage payment based on the principal amount, annual interest rate, and loan term.

## Formula

The monthly mortgage payment is calculated using the formula:

\[ M = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} \]

Where:

- \( M \) is the monthly mortgage payment.
- \( P \) is the principal loan amount.
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12).
- \( n \) is the number of payments (loan term in years multiplied by 12).

## Usage

To use this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can run the script from the command line or any Python IDE.
